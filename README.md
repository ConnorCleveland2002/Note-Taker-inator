# Note Taker-inator
In this assignment we creat a back end to an already made front end to add functionality to a site designed to store, add, and delete notes.
# Description
By using different packages, we enabled the API and HTMl to be routed correctly, and for the database to be stored as JSON files.
# Link
You'll find the link to the application here:  https://eleven-note-takerinator.herokuapp.com/index.html
